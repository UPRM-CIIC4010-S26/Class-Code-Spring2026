        When working with 2D structures we have 2 indexes
            matrix[row][col]

        One represents the row and the other the column (col).
        The order in which we access these indexes matters.

        The first index is for the row. 
            matrix[row]
        A row is a 1D vector when we access the second index we 
        are essentially are accessing an index in the 1D vector.

        EXAMPLE:
        Say we have this matrix:

        [[1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
         [6, 7, 8, 9, 10],
         [11, 12, 13, 14, 15]]

         If we call matrix[1], we call accessing this
         row: [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
         Then calling matrix[1][3] returns 9.
